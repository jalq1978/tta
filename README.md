# Text-to-Assistant: Your Conversational AI Assistant Generator 🤖
Are you new to building voice assistants with Voiceflow? Don't worry, we've got you covered! Introducing Text-to-Assistant, a powerful tool designed to help you take your first steps in creating conversational AI assistants with ease. 🚀

## Overview 📝
As Voiceflow enthusiasts, we understand that getting started with building assistants can be challenging at times. New users often struggle to adapt the templates provided during onboarding to real-world use cases. That's where Text-to-Assistant comes in! 💡

Text-to-Assistant is designed to simplify the process of creating voice assistants. While we initially attempted to train a model to understand Voiceflow's file structure, we ultimately opted for a more straightforward approach—training via prompt in a simplified version of the project file. This approach allows you to use the generated blueprint as a foundation for building your assistant. 🛠️

We also explored integrating a TikZ compiler to generate diagram representations of the assistant's flow. Although we couldn't fully implement this feature, we provide the TikZ code and instructions on how to compile it on Overleaf. 📊

With the right support from Voiceflow, we envision integrating Text-to-Assistant directly into the Voiceflow platform or as a ChatGPT plugin. This integration would enable users to seamlessly switch between automated and block-building voice assistants using a Push-to-Talk button or Prompt bar on the canvas. 🎛️

## How It Works 🧩
Text-to-Assistant uses a series of building blocks to create conversational AI applications. Each block has its own behavior and can be connected to create the desired flow. The available blocks include:

Start: The beginning of the application.
Talk: Presents text or voice.
Listen: Captures user input (e.g., known options or entire reply).
Condition: Forks directions based on variable values.
Set: Defines or alters variable values and states.
API: Connects to external services and retrieves responses.
JavaScript: Executes JavaScript code to manipulate variables.
End: The end of the application.
Text-to-Assistant will present the result in a structured format, along with a TikZ diagram to visualize the conversational AI application. 📐
